    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        My name is Jose Flores and I am a Veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard where I served for 8 years.
        I am a senior at Point Park University enrolled in the Information Technology
        program. I am a full-time intern for U.S. Steel working as an Application Architect in the
        Enterprise Architecture and Optimization Team. I enjoy developing my programming skills and I am highly
        interested in a career in development, project management/business analysis, or database management.
        Please continue browsing through my webpage for more information!

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>My interests include spending time with my wife and 3 year old daughter. As you can imagine, my life is quite
      busy with a 3 year old girl running around. When I am not working, going to school, or playing with my daughter, you can find
      me working out at my crossfit gym in the North Hills! </p>
